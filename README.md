## Project Description.

This is a react app that makes use of the sportsdata.io API to display sports information. Information obtained from this API is 'scrambled' and does not have accurate statistics, but the matchups, times and teams shown are all accurate. The link to the app will take you to the home page and links can be clicked to take you to the page for the NBA schedule, and another page to see the MLB schedule. There is a search bar at the top that when changed according to the format already in the bar, lets you search for games for the MLB and NBA by date. Also, for games that have already occured or are in progress for the NBA, you can click on the 'box score' link at the bottom and it will display game information to you.

## Example of data from API

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

## User Stories
As a user, I want to see the schedule of games for the given day
As a user, I want to see the box scores of games
As a user, I want to be able to search by date and see the games for a given date


## Planned improvements
- getting real time actual data from the API
- Using a table method in react to better render box score tables
- More styling with CSS flexbox
- Adding more user customization where users can select player names and get notified about changes in their statistics (potentially for betting purposes)

## Difficult Code Parts (part I plan to improve)
